<h3>Weekly schedule (will be updated as we go) </h3> 
<ul>
<li> Week 1: <a href="lecture_09_navier_stokes_alt2.pdf">Lecture 1 (notes updated Jan 20) </a> based on the <a href="1-s2.0-S0309170802000520-main.pdf">survey </a> 
<li> Week 2: continue on the lecture from last week. Small <a href="20210120123738.pdf">note </a> about the explicit scheme. 
    <li> Week 3: <a href="fem.pdf">Lecture notes </a>  <br> 
	    Note also that a gentle intro to FEM can be found <a href="../LangtangenMardal/doc/web/index.html">here </a>.  

</ul>

<h3> Exercises 
<ul>
<li> Develop a code for an explicit pressure correction scheme. Consider the application flow around cylinder,  
     say with a Renolds number 50. Details concerning 
     the flow around a cylinder test case can be found e.g. in chap 21 (21.4.5) of the 
    <a href="https://launchpadlibrarian.net/83776282/fenics-book-2011-10-27-final.pdf">FEniCS book. </a> 
     What are the expected stability constraints on dt? I am thinking of rough estimates in terms of
     finite difference, von Neumann analysis (e.g. Mat3360). 
<li> Try to solve the Poission problem with homogenous Dirichlet conditions in 1D using FEniCS, with elements of different orders.  
     Let the solution be u=sin(pi x) and calculate the right hand-side. Check wether integration by parts 
     has an effect. 
</ul>




<h3> Curriculum  </h3>
<ul>
<li>
The following <a href="book_jan13_2021.pdf"> lecture notes </a> goes through 
the finite element method (Chap 1), Convection diffusion (Chap 6), Stokes problem (Chap 7) 
We will go through at least these chapters. 
<li> Some associated slides for <a href="lecture_00_fem_introduction_alt.pdf">FEM </a>, 
<a href="lecture_08_stokes_alt.pdf">Stokes problem</a>.
<li>A <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/">FEniCS tutorial</a>. In general, more info on FEniCS like 
	installation procedures, user community etc can be found at <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">fenicsproject.org</a>.
